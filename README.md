# Portfolio Website

My own personal website that I'm building to showcase my skills and projects.

## Development Cycle

I start by writing down any thoughts I have into a notepad.

Any ideas that come from that I then put onto my [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/T4WPeKbE/portfolio-website) to help me keep track.

I then write the code in Visual Studio Code, making use of [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to automatically update any changes upon saving.

Once any changes are ready I then commit and push to Git, which automatically gets hooked to my website host.
